I'm creating a new git repository using:
-> git init
-> git commit (to create that first commit)
-> git status is important in checking to see "what's up"

Staging area is different from the working directory?
-> Yes, the staging area allows us to organize our changes in order to make logical commits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit?
-> Add the files to staging that you plan to commit. Group everything in the staging area like you were going to commit

Why are branches good?
-> Branches are great to create when you're creating experimental new features or different versions of the origin (such as JPN version or FRE version)

How do diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
-> Makes it obvious that branches are commits are all part of this parent-child structure
